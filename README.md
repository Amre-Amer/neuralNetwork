Organic Perceptrons:
Correction factor = target / prediction.
Back Propagation = Multiple each weight by the correction factor.
Each neuron can have unique number of inputs (and weights)
No layers, more difficult to set up (for now)
Simple math
Should scale up nicely
Benchmark by number of neurons
Need nice test data sets
