| What an adventure:
I started with Youtube.  After two weeks of education from brilliant minds, I started.
This neural network:
is for images
creates one node for each pixel.
each node tests (numPixels -1) connections to each one of its neighbors
each node has an inputValue and an outputValue
inputValue is pixel value (in this case 0 or 1)
outputValue is the ave of the neighboring pixel factors divided by the distance squared
neighboring pixel factors are the scale factors to multiply by to reach the neighboring values. 1 x 2 = 3, or 3 x .333 = 1
outputAll is the ave of the neighboring pixel outputVals weighted by distance to the image center. ` `                                                          |
